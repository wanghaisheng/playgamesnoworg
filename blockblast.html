                  <li><strong>Look at Upcoming Shapes</strong>: One of the most crucial strategies in Block Blast is to plan your moves by considering the shapes of the upcoming blocks.

Each successfully completed line scores points. You can clear lines horizontally or vertically. The game will end when the board becomes so crowded that no new blocks can be placed.
Although Block Blast is simple, the core mechanic relies on forethought and strategic planning.
- Strategic Planning
Always look at the shapes of the blocks that you'll get next. Try to envision how the blocks can maximize your line clears. Look at the entire board and evaluate the potential placement of the current block before you act.
- Clearing Blocks and Combos
Strategic placement of blocks is the key to long-term survival. Try to make complete lines by positioning blocks carefully to clear rows or columns efficiently.
Combo scoring is a big part of Block Blast. If you clear more than one line of blocks in a single move, your score will be multiplied. Make sure to plan strategically, to clear multiple lines using different formations.
- Powerups and Enhancements
Be careful when spending your power-ups in Block Blast. Sometimes it’s best to save them for when they are needed most.
- Leaderboards
Always try to achieve a better score than previous rounds. This will also improve your ranking on the leaderboard.
- Practice Makes Perfect
Like with any game, practice is the best way to improve. So play often and try to learn from the mistakes you make during your gaming rounds.</p></div></div></div>.</li>

Block Blast is a puzzle game where the goal is to fit different-shaped blocks on an 8×8 grid to form complete rows or columns. Each completed line disappears, awarding points to the player. The game ends when there are no more valid spaces for new blocks.

Gameplay Strategies
- Visualize Future Moves
One of the best tips to improve your Block Blast game is to look ahead. Before putting a block down, consider its impact on the next few moves. This approach involves thinking strategically.
- Plan Before Acting
It is crucial not to rush into placing blocks without considering all possibilities. Every move impacts future opportunities to clear lines, so try to see all available options before settling for a solution.
- Prioritize Clearing
While planning moves, focus more on clearing lines than on filling spaces randomly. You should keep clearing lines at the bottom to free up some space.
- Learn From Mistakes
When you encounter challenging levels, remember them and try to play it better each time you replay it. Understanding patterns and making improvements is the key to achieving high scores.
- Pay Attention to New Block Types
Use power-ups strategically: Learn how each power-up affects the game to make strategic decisions. The right time of using special boosts matters the most.</p></div></div></div>.</li>

- L-shaped blocks can fit many places on the game board. Always look for them first, since they can clear multiple lines at once. This is one of the best block blast strategies to clear the entire board fast and easy.
Tip # 2: Save Space To Make the Most of Power-Ups
Power-ups are game changers and should be used when necessary. Plan your moves to keep the most space possible. You do not need to use a power-up if the board is not crowded.
Tip # 3: Look at Upcoming Blocks
Check and see the block that are upcoming, as this helps you to decide your next move strategically. Doing this will prevent you from being cornered.
Tip # 4: Keep an Eye On Multiple Colors
Watch out for blocks that are grouped by color and strategically clear them first.
Tip # 5: Practice Makes Perfect
Practice a lot and learn from your mistakes. After some time, you'll be able to see patterns quickly and plan moves strategically.

- Always clear the bottom blocks before the top ones.
- Use power-ups only when you must.

I have played fairly casually, just once a day during a regular break. The game play is easy to understand and learn. Graphics are nice for blocks.. easy to see and appealing. I don’t listen to music or have sound on so can’t remark on that. The game play is smooth and no issues that I have come across. Some levels are a decent challenge but I like that you always start over on that level so you can remember where you messed up before. There are ads but not excessively or annoyingly, unlike many many games out there. All in all I highly recommend this block puzzle game for anyone looking for something to pass the time or just to relax playing. Wish more games were like this.

by ATgymnastMy whole family has downloaded this same game and it seems there are two different versions. One you get more points and different types of blocks. I want their version but am stuck with this version even when deleting and downloading again. Each family member either has version 1 or 2.

Okay, so i genuinely enjoy playing this game. the concept is fun and it’s a great way to pass time. however, this game has one massive drawback i’ve noticed that is so frustrating. there are certain shapes it will give you at the beginning that once you pass about 500 in score won’t give you any more. i’m talking about the single squares and diagonal squares that would save me so many rounds if i got them at later rounds. the game will start giving you shapes around the 1500 score that will auto fail you. highest i’ve ever gotten is 5300. i also would pay for an add free version if they had it but they don’t. i hate watching ads.. Developers, I hope you will take my suggestions and discuss them! Please contact me with your feedback. Thank you. CaitdaGreat78I want to start with, this game is exactly as shown in the ads, EXACTLY. There aren’t really any levels, but I love trying to beat my own high score. It only makes you watch ads if you choose to so you can save yourself. It’s so fun and I played it for hours until midnight.(whoops😅😅😬) The only problem is it’s so addictive that when I need to do other things I only want to play this. (I’m not faking it) I absolutely love this game. It’s so simple yet so fun. I recommend it. 👍👍😃 I sometimes put on a show I love and then just shrink it into the corner so I can watch it AND play the game. Some people don’t like it because it’s basic but I think that’s what makes it fun. I swear all games are sooo complicated and hard to understand or hard to complete but I like this one, it’s easygoing and fun. Not difficult to understand but challenging. (In a good way 👍) In the beginning it gives you a tutorial and then just launches you into the game. No WAY someone could say their confusedThis game would be great. However, in adventure mode after a certain number of rounds (not sure exactly how many) the game will intentionally give you combinations of pieces that make it impossible to win that level until you play it a few times. I’m sure this is designed to maximize revenue, as every time you lose you are forced to watch an ad. For example, after playing 9 levels on adventure round, the next level “forced” me to fail 4 times before it gave me pieces that even made that level possible, and I had to watch 4 ads as a result. (Or at least close and reopen BlockBlast to avoid the ad). I know you can’t really complain about it if it’s free, but at least be transparent about the gameplay being situationally rigged.
Love the game - not the ads
2025-09-18
by KIRPNWhelloSo I’ve been playing the classic game for hours testing my hypothesis and I’ve come to the conclusion the difficulty ramps from 0 to 100 as soon as you hit about 2000 points, I’ve noticed that with extensive testing on the beginning of the game they always give you a piece that fits if you know how to match shapes, then when you’ve hit just about 2000 suddenly they stop giving you bricks that fit and instead go completely randomWhile this game is fun, it is not the game advertised. This game you have a square grid that you fill in with Tetris shapes. Your goal is to simply clear lines of blocks that you have put together. You get bonus points if you can clear align within three moves. Added to your combo number. or another style is basically the same thing, what do you have certain objectives that you need to do to clear a level
The reason I say it’s not advertise is that what’s advertise is a huge Texas game. Nowhere have I seen that. Enjoy the game or not. But this company did the same thing. Most other companies are doing false advertising of their game. Disappointed I was looking forward to, the game that was played in the ad. Haven’t decided if I’m keeping it or not.
Ads. I love this app but for the ads.

Before downloading I read some reviews. No, there aren’t a lot of adds, unless you revive, but yeah. I really do think that the reviving is nice. It’s pretty addicting. The noises and clicks are really nice! I can tell the developers spent time making this game. And it definitely payed off. I’m not giving it 5 stars, only because it could be better. Sometimes they give blocks you can’t put in.
I also think that some reviews are lies, so please be careful! A lot of YouTubers have made videos about liking BlockBlast . But I’m also sure block blast reached out to them. Showing that they are kinda desperate. Or maybe they want downloads. But I can see why they like it. It’s an addicting game, it’s nice, it kills time. It doesn’t need Wi-Fi!</p></div></div></div>.</p>

Okay, so i genuinely enjoy playing this game. the concept is fun and it’s a great way to pass time. however, this game has one massive drawback i’ve noticed that is so frustrating. there are certain shapes it will give you at the beginning that once you pass about 500 in score won’t give you any more. i’m talking about the single squares and diagonal squares that would save me so many rounds if i got them at later rounds. the game will start giving you shapes around the 1500 score that will auto fail you. highest i’ve ever gotten is 5300. i also would pay for an add free version if they had it but they don’t. i hate watching ads.. Developers, I hope you will take my suggestions and discuss them! Please contact me with your feedback. Thank you. CaitdaGreat78I want to start with, this game is exactly as shown in the ads, EXACTLY. There aren’t really any levels, but I love trying to beat my own high score. It only makes you watch ads if you choose to so you can save yourself. It’s so fun and I played it for hours until midnight.(whoops😅😅😬) The only problem is it’s so addictive that when I need to do other things I only want to play this. (I’m not faking it) I absolutely love this game. It’s so simple yet so fun. I recommend it. 👍👍😃 I sometimes put on a show I love and then just shrink it into the corner so I can watch it AND play the game. Some people don’t like it because it’s basic but I think that’s what makes it fun. I swear all games are sooo complicated and hard to understand or hard to complete but I like this one, it’s easygoing and fun. Not difficult to understand but challenging. (In a good way 👍) In the beginning it gives you a tutorial and then just launches you into the game. No WAY someone could say their confusedThis game would be great. However, in adventure mode after a certain number of rounds (not sure exactly how many) the game will intentionally give you combinations of pieces that make it impossible to win that level until you play it a few times. I’m sure this is designed to maximize revenue, as every time you lose you are forced to watch an ad. For example, after playing 9 levels on adventure round, the next level “forced” me to fail 4 times before it gave me pieces that even made that level possible, and I had to watch 4 ads as a result. (Or at least close and reopen BlockBlast to avoid the ad). I know you can’t really complain about it if it’s free, but at least be transparent about the gameplay being situationally rigged.
Love the game - not the ads
2025-09-18
by KIRPNWhelloSo I’ve been playing the classic game for hours testing my hypothesis and I’ve come to the conclusion the difficulty ramps from 0 to 100 as soon as you hit about 2000 points, I’ve noticed that with extensive testing on the beginning of the game they always give you a piece that fits if you know how to match shapes, then when you’ve hit just about 2000 suddenly they stop giving you bricks that fit and instead go completely randomWhile this game is fun, it is not the game advertised. This game you have a square grid that you fill in with Tetris shapes. Your goal is to simply clear lines of blocks that you have put together. You get bonus points if you can clear align within three moves. Added to your combo number. or another style is basically the same thing, what do you have certain objectives that you need to do to clear a level
The reason I say it’s not advertise is that what’s advertise is a huge Texas game. Nowhere have I seen that. Enjoy the game or not. But this company did the same thing. Most other companies are doing false advertising of their game. Disappointed I was looking forward to, the game that was played in the ad. Haven’t decided if I’m keeping it or not.
Ads. I love this app but for the ads.

Before downloading I read some reviews. No, there aren’t a lot of adds, unless you revive, but yeah. I really do think that the reviving is nice. It’s pretty addicting. The noises and clicks are really nice! I can tell the developers spent time making this game. And it definitely payed off. I’m not giving it 5 stars, only because it could be better. Sometimes they give blocks you can’t put in.
I also think that some reviews are lies, so please be careful! A lot of YouTubers have made videos about liking BlockBlast . But I’m also sure block blast reached out to them. Showing that they are kinda desperate. Or maybe they want downloads. But I can see why they like it. It’s an addicting game, it’s nice, it kills time. It doesn’t need Wi-Fi!</p></div></div></div>.
